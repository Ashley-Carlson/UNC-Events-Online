		<p>This guide is intended to explain policies pertaining to Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs)
			and describe resources that may be helpful to RSOs. Because many departments at the University of Northern Colorado
			work with RSOs, a list of department contacts is included with this manual. Where applicable, this guide includes the
		 name of the best department to contact for the particular service or function.

			<br />
			<p>
				The Office of Student Clubs & Organizations at the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) requires all
				 Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs) to submit an updated constitution each academic year. A constitution
				 serves as the guiding document for your group and all RSOs must abide by their constitutions to maintain Active
				 RSO status. If you’d like help with your constitution,
				feel free to contact us at clubs@unco.edu. We’re happy to assist!
